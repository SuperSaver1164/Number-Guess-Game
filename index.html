   Welcome! The HTML in the <body> tag is what shows up on the page. Everything
   in the <head> is special and meant for behind-the-scenes configuration, like
   linking in our CSS and JavaScript code. Every HTML element that we intend to

   <p>Welcome to Curiosity Week! Let's play a game. 
      Please guess the number between 0 and 100</p>

   <!-- a text input and button wrapped in a form -->

      <!-- html5 number input, with form validation to 
         enforce min, max, and autocomplete turned off -->
      <input id="guess-input" type="number" min="0" max="100" autocomplete="off" />

      <!-- a "submit" button which triggers a "submit" event on the form that
         we can intercept in javascript to run our game logic -->
      <button id="guess-button" type="submit">Submit Guess</button>
   </form>

   <!-- h2 is a sub-heading, can have many in document (down to h3, h4, h5, h6) -->

   <p id="result">No current guess.</p>

   <!-- an olrdered list (lo) of all previous guesses, managed in javascript -->

      <!-- this paragraph tag isn't technically allowed, but its nice to show
         a message before the game starts, that will later be cleared, without
         having to use an <li> element and thus showing the auto-generated 
         bullet or number -->
